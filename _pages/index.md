## Neil Who?!

Oh man, if you don't know, your world is about to be rocked. Your mind melted. All of that.

Neil Postman (1931 — 2003) was an American cultural critic and educator. He wrote seventeen books. SEVENTEEN. His most famous was [Amusing Ourselves to Death](http://www.amazon.com/dp/014303653X/?tag=bletters-20), a screed against television and how it biases any message on it towards entertainment. Just imagine FOX News during an election and you'll get the idea.

His interests were all over the place. He wrote on the [disappearance of childhood](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0679751661/?tag=bletters-20), on [reforming public education](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0679750312/?tag=bletters-20), on [postmodernism](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0375701273/?tag=bletters-20), on [semantics and linguistics](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0440015545/?tag=bletters-20), and [technopolies](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0679745408/?tag=bletters-20). He also wrote essays and gave lectures about lots of other things that you can find if you scroll down long enough.

He was a professor of [media ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_ecology) at New York University and died of lung cancer.


## Where Do I Start?

I like your attitude, wanting to dig in like that. You're a curious person. Respect.

There's no question where you should start: his book [Amusing Ourselves to Death](http://www.amazon.com/dp/014303653X/?tag=bletters-20):

![Amusing Ourselves to Death Book Cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5159tELPeUL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

It was published in 1985. The foreword is brilliant. It's short, you can read it right here:

> We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.
>
> But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.
>
> What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions". In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.
>
> This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.

The book gets even better. It'll only take you a few hours to read it — a few hours to change your entire life. Seriously, why are you still here and not ordering it?

## Okay, Then What?

So you read AOtD and loved it. I'm not one to say "I told you so" but if I was this would totally be the place.

Now you're ready for a few more reads. Ask and ye shall receive:

## How does all this apply to the Internet?

Good question.

Instead of trying to answer that myself, here are some others that have wrestled with the issue:

## Factoids about Postman

* He hated answering machines. [src](http://allinonefilms.com/html_pages/postman.htm)

* He had a thing against cruise control. He once asked a salesperson, "What is the problem to which this is the solution?" He salesperson responded, "It's for people who have trouble keeping their foot on the gas petal." Postman replied that he had never had that problem before.

* He also had a thing against power windows. Same reason as cruise control.

## Appendix

What is an appendix for? Who knows. And yet, here it is.

(Actually it's probably for replenishing gut bacteria. But that's a different kind of appendix.)

### All the Postman books

You can see a [selected bibliography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman#Selected_bibliography) on Wikipedia. I'd sure pay a dollar to know what Neil would've thought about Wikipedia. The thing that really shouldn't work and yet works so well it has replaced encyclopedias.


### Who made this page?

Hey there, I'm Josh Sowin. I created this page back in 2005 because of the impact Postman had on me. These days I'm the CEO of Brainjolt, a viral content company that reaches half of America. We entertain people. Sure, I'll have a slice of that irony pie. But seriously, please enjoy comfort content in reasonable quantities. Life is short. Do things that matter.
